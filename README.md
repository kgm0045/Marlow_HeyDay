# Marlow_HeyDay
"Hey Day" is a long-standing Auburn University tradition that began in 1947 to help returning WWII veterans feel more welcome and connected. On October 18, 2023, the university will host Hey Day, featuring name tags, promotional items, a catered meal, a pep rally, and more. It's a cherished event that unites the Auburn community.
